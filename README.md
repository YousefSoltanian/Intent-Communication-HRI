\# Intent-Communication-HRI



This repository contains my IJRR work for intent communication and human-robot interaction experiments.

Modeling the human as an uncertain ILQgame/QMDP solvers, trying to learn the robot's intent using Bayesian belief update.

3 Examples: Intersection driving, Social Navigation, HRI Lunar Lander shared control.



Everything is in JAX and jaxified for faster real-time performance.



The HRI folder also contains experiment runners for a human actually interacting with the lunar lander in a computer.



In all folders, the main robot controller is the "N-PACE Influence" code. Simulation runners and experiment runner codes have the "demo" in their names.



I need to add needed dependencies and packages \[HERE]
